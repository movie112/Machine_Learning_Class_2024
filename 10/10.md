# Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

## 1. Problem definition

### (1) Data

The data consists of $\{(x_i, y_i, \ell_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ where $(x_i, y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ represent a point in 2-dimensional coordinate and $\ell_i \in \{0, 1\}$ represents its class label where $\ell_i = 0$ represents out-class and $\ell_i = 1$ represents in-class.

### (2) Classifier

The classifier is defined by a linear function that is a straight line passing through the origin $(0, 0)$ as follows:

$$
h(x, y) = \sigma(f(x, y)) = \sigma(\theta \cdot x - y)
$$

where $\theta, x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function defined by:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{(-z)}}
$$

The class label $\ell(x, y)$ is determined by the prediction value $h(x, y)$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\ell(x, y) =
   \begin{cases}
   1 \text{ (in-class)}, & \text{if} \ h(x, y) \ge 0.5\\
   0 \text{ (out-class)}, & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

### (3) ROC curve

The ROC curve is the plot of the true positive (TP) in y-axis again the false positive (FP) in x-axis at each threshold setting

#### True Positive

$$
TP = \frac{\text{number of detected in-class points (correct)}}{\text{number of in-class points}}
$$

#### False Positive

$$
FP = \frac{\text{number of detected out-class points (wrong)}}{\text{number of out-class points}}
$$

## 2. code completion

- complete `util.py` code
- run all the code cells in the jupyter notebook
- make `git commit` for the `util.py` file in such a way that your working progress is effectively presented

## 3. submission

1. jupyter notebook source files [.ipynb] - complete the jupyter notebook with all the results
   - `10.ipynb`
2. jupyter notebook pdf files [.pdf] - export the complete jupyter notebook to HTML and then PDF
   - `10.pdf`
3. GitHub history pdf file [.pdf] - export the GitHub history of the utility python file to a pdf file
   - `10_history.pdf`
4. python files [.py] - complete the utility python file
   - `util.py`
