# Assignment 11

# K-means clustering

## 1. Problem definition

### (1) Data

The data consists of $\{ (x_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$ where $z_i = (x_i, y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ represent a point in 2-dimensional space.

### (2) Notation

- $\ell(z)$ denotes the cluster label of point $z$
- $C_k = \{ z_i | \ell(z_i) = k \}$ denotes a set of points with the sampe labels
- $\mu_k$ denotes the centroid of cluster $C_k$

### (3) Loss

- the distance $d(p, q)$ between a pair of points $p, q \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by the square of $L_2$-norm as defined by:

$$
d(p, q) = \| p - q \|_2^2
$$

- the loss function with respect to a set of clusters $\{C_j\}_{j=1}^k$ and a set of their corresponding centroid $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1}^k$ is defined by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}\left( \{ C_j \}_{j=1}^k, \{ \mu_k \}_{j=1}^k \right) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n d(z_i, \mu_{\ell(z_i)})\\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \| z_i - \mu_{\ell(z_i)} \|_2^2\\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{z \in C_j}\| z - \mu_{j} \|_2^2
\end{align*}
$$

### (4) Optimization

- cluster label $\ell(z)$ for each point $z$ is determined by:

$$
\ell(z) = \arg\min_{j} \| z - \mu_j \|_2^2
$$

- centroid $\mu_j$ of cluster $C_j$ is determined by:

$$
\mu_j = \frac{1}{ \vert C_j \vert} \sum_{z \in C_j} z
$$

### (5) Initial condition

- the label of each point is randomly assigned as one of the values $\{0, 1,. \cdots, k-1\}$ for $k$ number of clusters at the initialization

### (6) Algorithm

```python
1. assign a random label to each point
2. for t in range(number of iterations):
3.      compute the centroid for each cluster
4.      assign the previous centroid if the cluster is empty
5.      compute the distance betwen each point to the centroids of all the clusters
6.      compute the label of each point by taking argmin over the distances
```

## 2. code completion

- complete `util.py` code
- run all the code cells in the jupyter notebook
- make `git commit` for the `util.py` file in such a way that your working progress is effectively presented

   - `11.ipynb`
2. jupyter notebook pdf files [.pdf] - export the complete jupyter notebook to HTML and then PDF
   - `11.pdf`
3. GitHub history pdf file [.pdf] - export the GitHub history of the utility python file to a pdf file
   - `11_history.pdf`
4. python files [.py] - complete the utility python file
   - `util.py`
