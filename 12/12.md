# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 1. Problem definition

### (1) Data

- the given data consists of $\{ (x_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$ where $z_i = (x_i, y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ represent a point in 2-dimensional space.

### (2) Normalization

- the data should be normalized in such a way that features $x$ and $y$ have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

$$
x = \frac{x - \mu_x}{\sigma_x}, \quad 
y = \frac{y - \mu_y}{\sigma_y}
$$

- $\mu_x$ denotes the mean of $x$
- $\sigma_x$ denotes the standard deviation of $x$
- $\mu_y$ denotes the mean of $y$
- $\sigma_y$ denotes the standard deviation of $y$

### (3) Covariance Matrix

- compute the co-variance matrix

$$
\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n z_i z_i^T = \frac{1}{n} Z^T Z, \quad Z = \begin{bmatrix} z_1^T \\ \vdots \\ z_n^T \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $n$ denotes the number of data

### (4) Principal Components

- compute the eigenvector and the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix

$$
\Sigma u = \lambda u
$$

- $u$ denotes an eigenvector and $\lambda$ denotes an eigenvalue of matrix $\Sigma$

- the principal components are defined by $\lambda u$

### (5) Projection of a point onto a line

- Let $z$ be a vector and $l = \{ c \cdot n \vert c \in \mathbb{R} \}$ be a line where $c$ is a scalar and $n$ be a unit vector
- Let $p$ be the orthogonal projection of $z$ onto the line $l$ spanned by a nonzero $c$
- Let $p = d \cdot n$ where $d$ is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the tip of vector $p$
- We have $n^T p = d \cdot n^T n$
- We have $n^T (z - p) = 0$ since $n$ and $z - p$ are orthogonal

$$
p = d \cdot n, \quad d = \frac{n^T p}{n^T n}, \quad n^T p = n^T z, \quad p = \left( \frac{n^T p}{n^T n} \right) n
$$


## 2. code completion
