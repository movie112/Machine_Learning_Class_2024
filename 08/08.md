# Logistic regression for a binary classification

## 1. Problem Definition

### (1) Training Data

The training data consists of $\{(x_i, y_i, \ell_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ where $(x_i, y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ represent a point in 2-dimensional coordinate and $\ell_i \in \{0, 1\}$ represents its class label.

### (2) Linear regression function

Let $p = (1, x, y)$ be a point and $\theta = (\theta_0, \theta_1, \theta_2)$ be a set of model parameters. The linear regression function is defined by:

$$
f(\theta; x, y) = \theta_0 * 1 + \theta_1 * x + \theta_2 * y = \theta^{T} p
$$

where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $p \in \mathbb{R}^3$.

### (3) Activation by Sigmoid function

The sigmoid function is defined by:

$$
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp{(-z)}}
$$

The derivative of sigmoid function is defined by:

$$
\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z) (1 - \sigma(z)).
$$

### (4) Logistic regression function

The logistic regression function is defined by:

$$
h(\theta; x, y) = \sigma(f(\theta; x, y)).
$$

### (5) Objective function

The objective function for the binary classification based on the logistic regression function is defined by:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \{ - \ell_i \log{(h_i)} - (1 - \ell_i) \log{(1 - h_i)} \}
$$

where $h_i = \sigma(f(\theta; x_i, y_i))$.

### (6) Optimization using the gradient descent algorithm

The optimization of the objective function $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ with respect to the model parameters $\theta$ using the gradient descent algorithm is given by:

$$
\theta^{t+1} \coloneqq \theta^{t} - \eta \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta^t)  
$$

where $t$ denotes iteration and $\eta$ denotes learning rate.

### (7) Optimal classifier

The classifier for point $(x, y)$ is given by the logistic regression function with obtained model parameters $\theta^*$ as given by:

$$
h(\theta^*; x, y)
$$

where

$$
\theta^* = \arg\min_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta)
$$
