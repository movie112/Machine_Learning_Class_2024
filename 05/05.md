## 1. Problem Definition

### Taylor Approximation

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function.

- First order Taylor approximation of $f(x)$ at $z$ is defined by:

$$
\hat{f}(x) = f(z) + f'(z) (x - z)
$$

- Second order Taylor approximation of $f(x)$ at $z$ is defined by:

$$
\hat{f}(x) = f(z) + f'(z) (x - z) + \frac{1}{2} f''(z) (x-z)^2
$$

## 2. code completion

- complete `util.py` code
- run all the cells in the jupyter notebook
- make `git commit` for the `util.py` file in such a way that your working progress is effectively presented

## 3. submission

1. jupyter notebook source files [.ipynb] - complete the jupyter notebook with all the results
   - `05.ipynb`
2. jupyter notebook pdf files [.pdf] - export the complete jupyter notebook to HTML and then PDF
   - `05.pdf`
3. GitHub history pdf file [.pdf] - export the GitHub history of the utility python file to a pdf file
   - `05_history.pdf`
4. python files [.py] - complete the utility python file
   - `util.py`
